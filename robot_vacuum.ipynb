    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement a simulator environment for an automatic vacuum cleaner robot, a set of different reflex-based agent programs, and perform a comparison study for cleaning a single room. Focus on the __cleaning phase__ which starts when the robot is activated and ends when the last dirty square in the room has been cleaned. Someone else will take care of the agent program needed to navigate back to the charging station after the room is clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PEAS description of the cleaning phase\n",
    "\n",
    "__Performance Measure:__ Each action costs 1 energy unit. The performance is measured as the sum of the energy units used to clean the whole room.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Environment:__ A room with $n \\times n$ squares where $n = 5$. Dirt is randomly placed on each square with probability $p = 0.2$. For simplicity, you can assume that the agent knows the size and the layout of the room (i.e., it knows $n$). To start, the agent is placed on a random square.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Actuators:__ The agent can clean the current square (action `suck`) or move to an adjacent square by going `north`, `east`, `south`, or `west`.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Sensors:__ Four bumper sensors, one for north, east, south, and west; a dirt sensor reporting dirt in the current square.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The agent program for a simple randomized agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent program is a function that gets sensor information (the current percepts) as the arguments. The arguments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A dictionary with boolean entries for the for bumper sensors `north`, `east`, `west`, `south`. E.g., if the agent is on the north-west corner, `bumpers` will be `{\"north\" : True, \"east\" : False, \"south\" : False, \"west\" : True}`.\n",
    "* The dirt sensor produces a boolean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent returns the chosen action as a string.\n",

    "3. You notebook needs to be formatted professionally.\n",
    "    - Add additional markdown blocks for your description, comments in the code, add tables and use mathplotlib to produce charts where appropriate\n",
    "    - Do not show debugging output or include an excessive amount of output.\n",

    "* Initialize the environment by storing the state of each square (clean/dirty) and making some dirty. ([Help with random numbers and arrays in Python](https://github.com/mhahsler/CS7320-AI/blob/master/HOWTOs/random_numbers_and_arrays.ipynb))\n",

    "* Keep track of the performance measure. That is, track the agent's actions until all dirty squares are clean and count the number of actions it takes the agent to complete the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest implementation for the environment is to hold an 2-dimensional array to represent if squares are clean or dirty and to call the agent function in a loop until all squares are clean or a predefined number of steps have been reached (i.e., the robot runs out of energy).\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation environment should be a function like the `simple_environment()` and needs to work with the simple randomized agent program from above. **Use the same environment for all your agent implementations in the tasks below.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note on debugging:* Debugging is difficult. Make sure your environment prints enough information when you use `verbose = True`. Also, implementing a function that the environment can use to displays the room with dirt and the current position of the robot at every step is very useful.  "

    "This environment is interesting because it actually fully breaks my model based agent, the model agent does not know what to do when it hits an obsticle and gets stuck in a loop. The other agents are not affected as much, but they do take slightly longer to clean the room. Some special logic would need to be added to the spiral agent to make it first find a corner, then it can know the count of how far over it is from the wall and determine if it is an obsticle or a wall it hits, then it would need to employ some sort of following tactic to follow the edge of the obticle until it reaches the other side. This would be a very complex task to implement and would require a lot of extra code."

For the implementation, we give the environment a 2-dimensional array of probabilities. The utility of a state is defined as the number of currently clean squares in the room. Implement a utility-based agent that maximizes the expected utility over one full charge which lasts for 100000 time steps. To do this, the agent needs to learn the probabilities with which different squares get dirty again. This is very tricky!"

    "For the first task you could pretty easily have the agent store the states of visited squares in cordinates from its starting point, then it could move to the closest unvisited square, however it would be tough to do this and account for objects simply because it does not have a way to distinguish an object from a wall, so it might forget squares exist if it assumes an object is the wall, or it might think squares still exist past the barricade if it assumes it is an object an not a wall. Because of this, I would think it might be better to do some sort of width test and height test to start then once it knows the size of the room, it can do DFS on the squares.\n",

    "    For the second task I would think you need to somehow keep track of which squares it has cleaned over number of moves since last visited that square and then it would need to estimate the probabilities and build a path that visits the higher probability squares too. I dont know what the exact math would be but it would have to be some weighted probability of moves since last seen. Maybe we could first do a training phase where the path is constant and then after is guesses the probability from the moves in the training phase it optimizes the path to hit the most dirty squares probabilistically."
